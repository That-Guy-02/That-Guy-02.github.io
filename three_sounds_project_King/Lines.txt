Line 1:
She's my first LOL OMG doll, I call her Poppy. She reminded me why I love being expressive. My dad growing up didn't express himself at all. If it's femme to be loud than I'd rather be loud than self-hating.

Line 2:
This is Yasmin from the Always Bratz line. She's called pretty princess for a reason! Look at her. My dad made fun of my softness but that allowed me to form loving relationships. He can't say the same.

Line 3:
Frankie Stein from Monster High here. The students of the disembody told me that being myself is beautiful. My dad always made fun of my quirks. Actually, most males did. If being masc meant being an asshole, I'm good!
